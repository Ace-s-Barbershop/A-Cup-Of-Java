## Background
Ace’s Barbershop – Fairly new barbershop in West Sacramento, Now that they have developed their clients relations they want to take their barbershop into new direction. They are finally going online for bookings, pricings and services available.

## Solution
Creating a website with all the barbers listed with their schedules and specialities. Customers get to see the recent haircuts from the barbers and be able to make appointments right from the website instead of calling the shop to verify.
